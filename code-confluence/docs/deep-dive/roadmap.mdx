Our roadmap outlines the key milestones in achieving comprehensive code confluence:

1. **Codebase Parsing** _(Beta)_ 🚧
   :::info In Progress
   Utilize Tree-Sitter and ANTLR for precise codebase parsing. Currently in beta testing phase.
   :::

2. **Domain Driven Graph-Based Representation** _(Beta)_ 🚧
   :::info In Progress
   Define a robust graph schema for domain-driven representation of codebase with all its data and metadata and ingest into compatible graph database.
   :::

3. **Knowledge Graph**
   - Embed code sections into a queryable knowledge graph

4. **Automated Documentation**
   - Summarize and visualize documentation automatically

5. **Integration SDK**
   - Develop SDK for knowledge engine integration
