# Product Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

**Vision**: Platform for code understanding, maintainability and collaboration through autonomous intelligence.

**Mission**: Enable AI agents to understand and act on codebases with precision and efficiency.

---

## 📊 Progress Overview

| Feature Category | Status |
|------------------|---------|
| Context Engineering (Python) | ✅ Stable |
| Discovery & Ingestion | ✅ Production Ready |
| AGENTS.md Framework | 🚀 Active Development |

---

## 🔧 Context Engineering
*Building the foundation for intelligent code understanding*

### Code Grammar Support for Programming Languages

Our advanced parsing engine provides deep syntactic and semantic understanding across multiple programming languages.

#### ✅ **Done**
- **Extensible Grammar Support for Programming Languages** - Tree sitter based grammar extraction..
- **Graph based hierarchical Contextual Understanding** - Graph based construction of context.
- **[Framework-specific Optimizations](https://docs.unoplat.io/contribution/custom-framework-schema)** - Programming language independent framework support

---

## 🔍 Discovery, Ingestion & Synchronization
*Seamlessly connect and sync your development ecosystem*

### 🎯 **Core Capabilities**

### ✅ **GitHub Native Integration**

Complete GitHub ecosystem integration for both open-source and private repositories.

**Accomplished Features**:
- **Repository Discovery** - Automatic detection and cataloging
- **Manual Synchronization** - On-demand repository updates

### ✅ **Reliable, Performant and Scalable Workflow Based Ingestion**

Uses Workflow Orchestrator to ingest codebases in a performant and scalable way.

### ✅ **Status Tracking and Feedback**

Any failures encountered during ingestion are tracked and reported back to the user 

---

## 🤖 AGENTS.md Initiative
*Building agents to make repositories AI-ready*

### 🚀 **Current Focus**
*Active Development*

Building first set of agents to automatically initialize and maintain AGENTS.md files for repositories.

**Purpose**: Enable AI coding assistants to better understand and work with any codebase by providing standardized context.

**Milestone**: [Code Confluence v1 (Issue #722)](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/issues/722)

**Agent Capabilities**:
- **Development Workflow Analysis** - Extract build commands, dev test procedures.
- **Domain Understanding** - Precisely identify application data models as well as database entities to understand the domain.
- **Application Interface Understanding** - Precisely identify application interfaces in terms of inbound/outbound interfaces. For example, HTTP endpoints, message consumers, etc.
- **Dependency Understanding** - Enrich codebase context with third-party dependencies and their roles.
