## 🔧 Context Engineering
*Building the foundation for intelligent code understanding*

### Code Grammar Support for Programming Languages

Our advanced parsing engine provides deep syntactic and semantic understanding across multiple programming languages.

#### ✅ **Done**
- **Python Grammar** - Full syntax support with advanced AST parsing
  - Complete language feature coverage
- **[Framework-specific Optimizations](https://docs.unoplat.io/contribution/custom-framework-schema)** - Programming language independent framework support

---

## 🔍 Discovery, Ingestion & Synchronization
*Seamlessly connect and sync your development ecosystem*

### 🎯 **Core Capabilities**
*Available across all integration types*

- **Auto Codebase Detection** - Comprehensive codebase scanning among mono repositories
- **Tree-sitter Based Language Feature Specific Ingestion** - Tree-sitter based code grammar extraction and graph ingestion

### ✅ **GitHub Native Integration**

Complete GitHub ecosystem integration for both open-source and private repositories.

**Accomplished Features**:
- **Repository Discovery** - Automatic detection and cataloging
- **Manual Synchronization** - On-demand repository updates

### ✅ **Local Git Repository Support**

Direct integration with local development environments for immediate code analysis.

**Features**:
- **Manual Near Real-time Sync** - Instant local repository updates

## 🤖 AGENTS.md Initiative
*Building agents to make repositories AI-ready*

### 🚀 **Current Focus**
*Active Development*

Building first set of agents to automatically initialize and maintain AGENTS.md files for repositories.

**Purpose**: Enable AI coding assistants to better understand and work with any codebase by providing standardized context.

**Milestone**: [Code Confluence v1 (Issue #722)](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/issues/722)

**Agent Capabilities**:
- **Repository Analysis** - Analyze repository structure and generate initial AGENTS.md
- **Context Extraction** - Extract build commands, test procedures, and coding standards
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identify project-specific patterns and conventions
- **Maintenance** - Maintain and update AGENTS.md as codebase evolves
- **AI Assistant Integration** - Provide context for AI coding assistants to work effectively
