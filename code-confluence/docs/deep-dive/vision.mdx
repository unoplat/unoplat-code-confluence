## 🎯 Our Mission

Unoplat Code Confluence aims to be the definitive solution for extracting, understanding, and providing precise code context across repositories and domains. We believe that combining deterministic code grammar with state-of-the-art LLM pipelines can achieve human-like understanding of codebases in minutes rather than months.

## 🌟 Why Unoplat Code Confluence?

### Core Principles

1. **Precision First**
   - **Universal Language Support**: Tree-sitter based grammar extraction delivers consistent, accurate code context across all programming languages
   - **Framework-Aware Parsing**: Specialized grammar engines recognize framework and library-specific patterns based on project dependencies, ensuring contextually relevant code understanding

2. **AI-Powered Understanding**
   - **Agentic GraphRAG Tools**: Purpose-built AI agents powered by right tools and MCP servers deliver predictable outcomes
   - **Human-in-the-Loop Approach**: Interactive AI assistance that combines automated analysis with human validation to ensure accuracy and relevance in all conversations

3. **Graph Intelligence**
   - **GraphRAG for Deep Contextual Queries**: Advanced graph-based retrieval augmented generation enables complex code exploration.
   - **Seamless Workflow-Based Ingestion**: Graph ingestion workflows preserve all critical relationships between code constructs, dependencies, and architectural patterns

4. **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**
   - Scalable and reliable processing powered by workflow orchestrator.
