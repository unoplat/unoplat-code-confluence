# Vision: The Universal Code Context Engine


## ðŸŽ¯ Our Mission

Unoplat Code Confluence aims to be the definitive solution for discovering, extracting, ingesting , understanding, and providing precise code context across repositories. We believe that combining deterministic code grammar with state-of-the-art LLM pipelines can unlock a wide range of usecases around code understanding, maintainability and collaboration.

## ðŸŒŸ Why Unoplat Code Confluence?

### Core Principles

1. **Precision First**
   - **[Extensible Language Support](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/tree/main/unoplat-code-confluence-ingestion/code-confluence-flow-bridge/src/code_confluence_flow_bridge/parser/queries)**: Modular Tree-sitter based grammar extraction delivers consistent, accurate code context across all programming languages
   - **[Extensible Framework-Aware Parsing](https://docs.unoplat.io/contribution/custom-framework-schema)**: Specialized grammar engines recognize framework and library-specific patterns based on project dependencies, ensuring contextually relevant code understanding

    
2. **Context Engineering**
   - **Complete Context Graph**: All essential contextâ€”internal/external dependencies, inbound/outbound interfaces, domain models (entities/events), data stores, and service-to-service linksâ€”kept fresh via workflow-based ingestion into the Graph.
   - **Efficient Context Pruning & Sub-task Decomposition**: Dynamic token pruning and hierarchical task breakdown ensure optimal performance across both SOTA closed-source and open-source models, delivering precise context without overwhelming LLM attention mechanisms. 

3. **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**
   - Scalable and reliable processing powered by workflow orchestrator.

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimized algorithms across all aspects of discovery , detection , ingestion and ai based insights.

## ðŸš€ Use Cases

### In Progress
1. **AGENTS.md-first Context**: Auto-generate machine-readable AGENTS.md per repo and an org index, giving any coding agent a precise source of truth.

### Planned
1. **Application Overview**: Comprehensive understanding of application architecture, dependencies, and relationships through graph-based exploration.

## ðŸ“‹ Alpha Disclaimer

We would want to be transparent about our current state. While we're deeply committed to our core principles and have invested significant engineering effort to uphold them, Unoplat Code Confluence is currently in alpha. Despite our best intentions and rigorous development practices, there may be areas where we haven't fully achieved these principles yet.

If you encounter any gaps between our stated vision and the current implementation, or if you have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to engage with us:

- **Report Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/issues)
- **Start Discussions**: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/discussions)

Your feedback is invaluable as we work toward production readiness and helps us prioritize our roadmap to better serve the developer community.
