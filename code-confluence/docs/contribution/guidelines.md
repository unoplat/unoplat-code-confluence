# Contribution Guidelines

## Current Project Status

Code Confluence is currently in alpha stage of development. During this phase, we are not accepting direct code contributions as the core architecture and features are still being actively developed and may undergo significant changes.

## How You Can Help

While we're not accepting code contributions at this time, there are still valuable ways you can help improve Code Confluence:

### Reporting Bugs üêõ

If you encounter any bugs or issues:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported in our GitHub issues
2. If not, create a new issue following our bug report template
3. Provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. Include relevant information about your environment
5. Add screenshots if applicable

### Feature Requests üí°

Have ideas for new features or improvements?

1. Check our existing issues and feature requests first
2. Create a new issue.
3. Clearly describe the feature and its use cases
4. Explain how it would benefit the project and its users


We appreciate your interest in Code Confluence and look forward to your feedback as we continue to develop the project!
