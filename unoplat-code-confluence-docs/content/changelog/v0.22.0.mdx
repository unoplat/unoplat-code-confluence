## Highlights

This release marks a significant architectural simplification by migrating from Neo4j to PostgreSQL for knowledge graph storage, reducing operational complexity while maintaining performance through optimized rdbms schema.

## What's New

### PostgreSQL Migration (Major)

- Migrated ingestion and query engine services to PostgreSQL
- Removed Neo4j related models, schema, and dependencies

### Infrastructure Savings

By removing Neo4j and consolidating on PostgreSQL (which was already required for Temporal workflow data), self-hosted deployments benefit from reduced resource requirements:

| Resource | Neo4j Requirement | Savings |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **RAM** | 2GB minimum (8GB+ recommended for production) | 2-8GB freed |
| **CPU** | 2 vCPU minimum (16+ recommended) | 2+ vCPU freed |
| **JVM Overhead** | Requires Java runtime | Eliminated |

### Documentation Improvements

- Added common links in sidebar for better navigation
- Zoom and preview support across all MDX docs
- Submit feedback documentation added
- Changelog RSS feed with theme alignment

## Bug Fixes

- System prompt refinements for improved agent descriptions
- Validations and Retries across agent harness to improve compatibility with open source models. 
- Framework/lib features' detection across codebase for inbound and outbound interfaces refactored from structural signatures to source code analysis which will improve scalability across programming languages.
- Owner name fallback for user repositories
- Theme-based icon color adjustments
- Changelog sorting by release date and version number
- Documentation content improvements
