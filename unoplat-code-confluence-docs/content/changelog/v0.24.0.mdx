### MCP Tool Management

- Full CRUD operations for MCP tools via the frontend
- Schema-based authentication support for MCP tools
- Dedicated MCP tool section for agent MD operations

### UI Improvements

- Intuitive error display for agent MD operations
- DateTime offset fixes across backend operations
- Migration from standard FastAPI MCP client to pydantic fastmcp for async reliability issues while doing mcp operations in temporal activities
- MDX editor styling fixes removing unnecessary class applications
- Test container v4 API compatibility fixes for query engine tests
