# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to **Unoplat Code Confluence** - Your Gateway to Code Understanding!

<Callout type="info" title="Current Status">
Unoplat Code Confluence currently supports **Python** and **TypeScript** codebases and is in **alpha** stage. We're actively working on expanding language support and features.

Best suited for *developers* and *tech enthusiasts* who enjoy exploring new tools, don't mind a few rough edges, and are willing to provide feedback as we work towards establishing a complete end-to-end workflow!
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tool installed:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [**Docker & Docker Compose**](https://www.portainer.io/) | For running services |

## Setting Up Code Confluence

Follow these steps to set up Code Confluence:

1. **Create Project Directory and Download Configuration:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p code-confluence && cd code-confluence

   # Download Docker Compose file
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/refs/heads/main/prod-docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. **Launch Services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f prod-docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f prod-docker-compose.yml ps
   ```

## Running the Application

### 1. Access the Web Interface
- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 2. Connect a Repository Provider
- When prompted, select your repository provider and enter a Personal Access Token (PAT) with read access to the repositories you want to ingest.
- This is required for Code Confluence to clone and analyze your repositories.

Code Confluence supports **two provider options**:

#### GitHub
For **GitHub.com** and **standard GitHub Enterprise Cloud** users:
1. Select **GitHub** from the Provider dropdown
2. Enter your Personal Access Token
3. Click **Connect**

![Connect GitHub Provider](../../../src/assets/images/add-repository-provider.png)

#### GitHub Enterprise
For **Enterprise Server (self-hosted)** or **Enterprise Cloud with data residency**:
1. Select **GitHub Enterprise** from the Provider dropdown
2. Enter your **Base URL** (e.g., `https://yourcompany.ghe.com` or `https://github.mycompany.com`)
3. Enter your Personal Access Token
4. Click **Connect**

![Connect GitHub Enterprise Provider](../../../src/assets/images/github-enterprise.png)

<Callout type="info" title="Getting a GitHub PAT">
If you don't have a GitHub PAT:
1. Click "Generate token on GitHub" (or "Generate token on GitHub Enterprise") to create a new token
2. Copy the generated token and paste it in the Personal Access Token field
3. Click **Connect** to add the provider
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="GitHub Enterprise Testing Status">
- **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** (standard): Tested and working
- **GitHub Enterprise Server** (self-hosted): Not yet fully tested
- **Enterprise Cloud with data residency**: Not yet fully tested

If you're using self-hosted Enterprise Server or Enterprise Cloud with data residency and encounter any issues, please [report them on our GitHub Issues](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/issues) to help us improve support.
</Callout>

### 3. Search for GitHub Repositories
- Press **`s`** or **`S`** (Shift + s) to open the *search dialog*.
- You can search through your *personal*, *public*, and *open source* repositories.

![Search for Repository](../../../src/assets/images/repository_search.png)

### 4. Ingest Repository
- In the **Actions** column, click on **Ingest Repo** for the repository you want to analyze.
- Code Confluence will *automatically detect* Python and TypeScript codebases as part of repository along with corresponding *package manager metadata*.

![Ingest Repo Action](../../../src/assets/images/repository_ingest_action.jpeg)

<Callout type="warn" title="Codebase Detection - Beta Feature">
Automatic codebase detection is currently in beta and may have bugs. After ingestion completes:

1. Navigate to **Ingestion Management** to review your repository ingestion results
2. Verify that all expected codebases were detected correctly
3. Check for any errors or missing codebases

![Ingestion Management - Codebases Ingested](../../../src/assets/images/codebases-ingested.png)

If you encounter any issues, such as codebases not being detected or errors during ingestion, please [**report them on our GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/issues).
</Callout>

### 5. Configure Model Provider

After ingestion completes, configure your *AI model provider* to enable **code intelligence** features.

- Navigate to **Settings > Model Providers** in the application
- Code Confluence supports *multiple AI model providers* for code analysis and understanding

#### Recommended Configuration: OpenRouter with Grok

We recommend using **OpenRouter** with the `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` model, which we've tested extensively for *optimal performance* and *efficiency*.

**Setup Steps**:
1. Select **OpenRouter** from the *Provider* dropdown
2. Enter your OpenRouter API key in the **API key** field
3. Set the **Model name** to `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1`
4. Click **Save Configuration**

![Model Provider Configuration - OpenRouter](../../../src/assets/images/model-provider.png)

<Callout type="info" title="Getting an OpenRouter API Key">
If you don't have an OpenRouter API key:
1. Visit [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) and create an account
2. Navigate to your API Keys section
3. Generate a new API key and copy it

OpenRouter provides access to multiple AI models including Grok with competitive pricing.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Other Model Providers">
While we recommend **OpenRouter with Grok** for the best experience, Code Confluence supports *other model providers* as well. You can experiment with different providers and models based on your preferences and requirements.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="Known Limitations">
**Provider Support**: Most *standard AI model providers* are supported. We have tested **OpenRouter** with the following models:
- `moonshotai/kimi-k2` (Kimi K2 Thinking)
- `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` (Grok Code Fast 1)
- `minimax/minimax-m1` (MiniMax M1)

If you encounter issues with a specific provider, please report them on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/issues) page.
</Callout>

### 6. Repository Operations

After successfully ingesting your repository, you can perform various operations to manage your codebase. Navigate to **Ingestion Management** to access these operations.

![Repository Operations](../../../src/assets/images/repository-operations.png)

Code Confluence provides **three key repository operations**:

- **Generate Agents.md** — *Automatically generates* required metadata for AI agents to understand your codebase and operate on it effectively.
- **Refresh Repository** — *Updates* your ingested codebase to reflect the latest changes from the source repository
- **Delete Repository** — *Removes* the ingested repository and all associated data from Code Confluence

#### `AGENTS.md`

When you trigger the **Generate Agents.md** operation:

1. Navigate to **Workspace > Operations Management** in the sidebar
2. Find your **Agents Generation** job in the operations table
3. Click the **Actions** menu (`...`) for your job and select **View Details**

![Operations Management Panel](../../../src/assets/images/operations-panel.png)

You can monitor the progress *in real-time*. The workflow shows progress for each codebase individually, as well as *overall progress* when your repository contains multiple codebases. You can view **agent events** in real-time as actions are performed.

![AGENTS.md Workflow Progress](../../../src/assets/images/agents-md-workflow.png)

You can continue ingesting and generating `AGENTS.md` for **multiple repositories in parallel** until you reach the *maximum tokens per second* limit of your model provider.

The generated `AGENTS.md` provides **structured documentation** covering:
- **Project Structure** — Overview of your *codebase organization*
- **Development Workflow** — *Development practices* and patterns
- **Business Logic** — Core functionality and *domain logic*

![AGENTS.md Preview Result](../../../src/assets/images/agents-md-preview-result.png)

<Callout type="info" title="Coming Soon">
We're continuously expanding the `AGENTS.md` sections to provide even more *comprehensive codebase documentation* for AI agents.
</Callout>
