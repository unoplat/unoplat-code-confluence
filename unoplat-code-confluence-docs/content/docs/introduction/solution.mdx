<Callout type="info" title="Our Mission">
  Unoplat Code Confluence is the **context engine** for application development, organizing precise, up-to-date knowledge of your *data models*, *entry points*, *endpoints*, and more—so coding agents can deliver and maintain features **2–3x faster** with higher quality.
</Callout>

## The Solution

### Unoplat Code Confluence App Context

**`AGENTS.md`-first Context**: Auto-generates machine-readable `AGENTS.md` files *per repo* to give coding agents a **precise source of truth** which covers the following key areas:

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Settings />} title="Project Configuration">
    Key **config files** and their responsibilities
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Workflow />} title="Development Workflow">
    *Dev/build/test* commands, infra, and third-party dependencies
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Brain />} title="Business Logic">
    Core application logic, **domain entities**, and **database entities**
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Plug />} title="Entry Points & Interfaces">
    Main *entry points*, **API endpoints**, and external interfaces
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Package />} title="External Dependencies">
    Roles and responsibilities of *external libraries*
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<GitBranch />} title="Cross-repo Linkage">
    Connections to **related repositories** and codebases within the org
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Core Principles

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Target />} title="Precision First">
    [Extensible Language Support](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/tree/main/unoplat-code-confluence-ingestion/code-confluence-flow-bridge/src/code_confluence_flow_bridge/parser/queries): Modular **Tree-sitter** based grammar extraction delivers *consistent, accurate* code context across all programming languages. [Extensible Framework-Aware Parsing](/docs/contribution/custom-framework-schema): Specialized grammar engines recognize *framework and library-specific patterns*.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Layers />} title="Context Engineering">
    All important metadata about application—*dependencies*, *inbound/outbound interfaces*, *domain models*, and *data store models*—are identified and their relationships preserved.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Shield />} title="Enterprise-Grade Scalability, Reliability and Auditability">
    Scalable, auditable and reliable processing powered by *workflow orchestrator*.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Zap />} title="Performance as a First-Class Citizen">
    Optimized algorithms across all aspects of *discovery*, *detection*, *ingestion* and *LLM-based insights*.
  </Card>
</Cards>

<Callout type="warn" title="Alpha Disclaimer">
  We want to be **transparent** about our current state. While we're deeply committed to our core principles and have invested significant engineering effort to uphold them, Unoplat Code Confluence is currently in **alpha**. Despite our best intentions and rigorous development practices, there may be areas where we haven't fully achieved these principles yet.

  If you encounter any *gaps* between our stated vision and the current implementation, or if you have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to engage with us:

  - **Report Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/issues)
  - **Start Discussions**: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/discussions)

  Your feedback is *invaluable* as we work toward production readiness and helps us prioritize our roadmap to better serve the developer community.
