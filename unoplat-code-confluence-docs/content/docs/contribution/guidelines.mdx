# Contribution Guidelines

## Current Project Status

Code Confluence is currently in **alpha** stage of development. During this phase, we are *not accepting direct code contributions* as the core design, architecture, and features are still being actively developed and may undergo significant changes.

## How You Can Help

While we're not accepting code contributions at this time, there are still **valuable ways** you can help improve Code Confluence:

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any *bugs* or *issues*:

1. **Check** if the issue has already been reported in our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-code-confluence/issues)
2. If not, **create a new issue** following our bug report template
3. Provide **detailed steps** to reproduce the issue
4. Include relevant information about your *environment*
5. Add **screenshots** if applicable

### Feature Requests

Have ideas for *new features* or *improvements*?

1. **Check** our existing issues and feature requests first
2. **Create a new issue**
3. Clearly describe the feature and its *use cases*
4. Explain how it would **benefit** the project and its users

We appreciate your interest in Code Confluence and look forward to your feedback as we continue to develop the project!
