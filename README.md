# Unoplat-CodeConfluence - The Universal Code Context Engine

## üéØ Vision

Unoplat-CodeConfluence aims to be the definitive solution for extracting, understanding, and providing precise code context across repositories and domains. By combining deterministic code grammar with state-of-the-art LLM pipelines, we achieve human-like understanding of codebases in minutes rather than months. Our graph-based architecture ensures relationships and context are preserved at every level.

## üåü Why Unoplat-CodeConfluence?

- **Deterministic Understanding**: Built on ArchGuard and Tree-sitter for reliable, language-agnostic code parsing
- **Smart Summarization**: Bottom-up code analysis from functions to entire codebases, preserving context at every level
- **Graph based Embedding**: Embed codebases' functions using SOTA embeddings to enable semantic search and retrieval
- **Enhanced Onboarding**: Intuitive, interconnected documentation helps new team members understand complex codebases quickly
- **Graph-Based Intelligence**: Query and explore codebases through natural, graphical relationships between components
- **Deep Dependency Insights**: Comprehensive parsing of package managers as well as any other related metadata reveals true project structure and relationships.
- **Integration Ready**: Designed to work seamlessly with your existing development tools and workflows

## ü§ù For Knowledge Engine and AI Coding Assistants

Unoplat-CodeConfluence will provide:

- **Precise Context API**: Get reliable, deterministic code understanding through:
  - Bottom-up code summarization from functions to systems
  - Graph-based querying on SOTA embeddings with deterministic code grammar for natural code exploration.
  - Deep package and dependency analysis

## üîç OSS Atlas Initiative

Our [UnoplatOssAtlas](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-oss-atlas/tree/main) project is designed to dramatically accelerate contributor onboarding and productivity in open-source projects. By providing deep, contextual understanding of popular repositories, we will help developers in the following:

- **Accelerate Onboarding**: Understand complex codebases in minutes instead of months
- **Boost Contribution Velocity**: Make meaningful contributions faster with deep contextual insights
- **Navigate Complex Systems**: Easily understand dependencies, patterns, and architectural decisions
- **Learn Best Practices**: Study and adopt patterns from well-established open-source projects

This initiative demonstrates our commitment to:

- Empowering the open-source ecosystem by reducing barriers to contribution
- Showcasing practical applications of our context extraction capabilities
- Supporting sustainable open-source development through better understanding and reducing time to value for oss projects.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to enhance your development workflow? 
Check out our [Quick Start Guide](https://unoplat.github.io/unoplat-code-confluence/docs/quickstart/how-to-run) 
We ran our code graph capability on [Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx) for its python backend and here is
