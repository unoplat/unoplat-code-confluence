# Unoplat-CodeConfluence - The Universal Code Context Engine

## üéØ Vision

Unoplat-CodeConfluence aims to be the definitive solution for extracting, understanding, and providing precise code context across repositories and domains. By combining deterministic code grammar with state-of-the-art LLM pipelines, we achieve human-like understanding of codebases in minutes rather than months. Our graph-based architecture ensures relationships and context are preserved at every level.

## üåü Why Unoplat-CodeConfluence?

- **Precision First**: Built for deterministic and accurate code context extraction using Antlr and tree-sitter grammars
- **AI-Powered Understanding**: Advanced LLM pipelines that comprehend code relationships and semantics just like humans based on inhouse graph based structures and parsing algorithms.
- **Graph Intelligence**: Uses graph databases for both ingestion and querying, enabling deep contextual understanding
- **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**: Powered by workflow orchestration for scalable and reliable processing
- **Cross-Repository Intelligence**: Understand relationships between codebases across your domain
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Parse and analyze package dependencies and project configurations
- **Integration Ready**: Designed to enhance existing AI coding tools and knowledge bases
- **Open Source Foundation**: Built transparently with and for the developer community


## ü§ù For Knowledge Engine and AI  Coding Assistants' Integration Partners

 Unoplat-CodeConfluence will provide:

- High-precision code context API powered by graph-based retrieval
- Cross-repository semantic understanding through LLM pipelines
- Reduced operational complexity for context extraction
- Ready-to-use integration with popular tools like OpenDevin, Devon, Danswer, and Continue Dev

## üîç OSS Atlas Initiative

Our [UnoplatOssAtlas](https://github.com/unoplat/unoplat-oss-atlas/tree/main) project is designed to dramatically accelerate contributor onboarding and productivity in open-source projects. By providing deep, contextual understanding of popular repositories, we will help developers in the following:

- **Accelerate Onboarding**: Understand complex codebases in minutes instead of months
- **Boost Contribution Velocity**: Make meaningful contributions faster with deep contextual insights
- **Navigate Complex Systems**: Easily understand dependencies, patterns, and architectural decisions
- **Learn Best Practices**: Study and adopt patterns from well-established open-source projects

This initiative demonstrates our commitment to:

- Empowering the open-source ecosystem by reducing barriers to contribution
- Showcasing practical applications of our context extraction capabilities
- Supporting sustainable open-source development through better understanding and reducing time to value for oss projects.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to enhance your development workflow? 
Check out our [Quick Start Guide](https://unoplat.github.io/unoplat-code-confluence/docs/quickstart/how-to-run) 
We ran our code graph capability on [Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx) for its python backend and here is
