        "summary": "## Class Summary: [OrderController]\nThe OrderController class handles HTTP requests related to orders within a system that manages products and their prices. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on order entities through various endpoints. The controller utilizes the Spring Framework's MVC architecture for web application development and integrates with an OrderRepository component to interact with data sources using Java Persistence API (JPA).\n\n## Fields\n- **OrderRepository**: `Autowired`\n  - Type: Injected dependency that provides CRUD operations on order entities. The Spring framework's `@Autowired` annotation is used for automatic dependency injection of the repository instance into the OrderController class. This allows easy access to data layer functionality through defined methods within the OrderRepository interface/class.\n\n## Methods\n- **root()**: `ModelAndView`\n  - Summary: Displays a redirection view that navigates users to the Swagger UI page for API documentation and testing. This method is typically mapped to the base path of the API, such as \"/orders\".\n  \n- **createOrder(HttpServletRequest request)**: `Order`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP POST requests to create new order entities in the data source by extracting relevant information from the HttpServletRequest object and saving it using OrderRepository.save(). This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders\".\n  \n- **updateOrder(HttpServletRequest request)**: `Order`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP PUT requests for updating existing order entities by retrieving the current state of the entity, modifying it based on provided parameters in HttpServletRequest, and then persisting changes using OrderRepository.save(). This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders/{id}\".\n  \n- **deleteOrder(HttpServletRequest request)**: `void`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP DELETE requests for deleting specific order entities by retrieving the entity's primary key from HttpServletRequest and removing it using OrderRepository.deleteByKeyOrderIdAndKeyProductId() or OrderRepository.deleteByKeyOrderId(). This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders/{id}\" or \"/orders/\".\n  \n- **deleteOrders(HttpServletRequest request)**: `void`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP DELETE requests for deleting multiple order entities by identifying a filter criteria (e.g., all orders with a specific product ID) and removing them using OrderRepository.deleteByKeyOrderId(). This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders/product/{id}\".\n  \n- **findOrder(HttpServletRequest request)**: `ProductNameAndPrice`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP GET requests for retrieving a single order entity's details by its primary key, which can be extracted from HttpServletRequest. The method utilizes OrderRepository.findByKeyOrderIdAndKeyProductId() to fetch the corresponding data and wrap it in a ProductNameAndPrice object before returning it as an API response. This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders/{id}\".\n  \n- **findOrders(HttpServletRequest request)**: `List<ProductNameAndPrice>`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP GET requests for retrieving multiple order entities' details, optionally filtered by a specific primary key value. The method utilizes OrderRepository.findByKeyOrderId() to fetch the corresponding data and return it as a list of ProductNameAndPrice objects in the API response. This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders/{id}\" or \"/orders\".\n  \n- **findAll(HttpServletRequest request)**: `List<ProductNameAndPrice>`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP GET requests for retrieving all order entities' details by leveraging OrderRepository.findAllProjectedBy(). This method provides a list of ProductNameAndPrice objects representing the complete set of orders in the system, excluding any deleted records (soft delete strategy). It is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders\".\n\nPlease note that for each method mapping and HTTP request processing, annotations such as `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc., would be used within a Spring MVC controller class. Additionally, you may need to import classes/packages required by the methods (e.g., HttpServletRequest) depending on your project setup."

It is responsible for defining the unique identifier for each order and its associated product. The class implements `Serializable` interface to enable storage and retrieval of instances from the Cassandra database. \n\n## Package\n- `com.datastax.examples.order`\n\n## File Path\n- `/src/main/java/com/datastax/examples/order/OrderPrimaryKey.java`\n\n## Responsibility\nThis class defines a composite primary key with two components: order ID and product ID. Both fields are of type `UUID`. The `orderId` field serves as the partition key, whereas the `productId` is used as the clustering column within that partition. \n\n## Fields\n- **UUID**: `orderId`\n    - **Type**: This UUID field represents a unique identifier for an order in the Cassandra database. It serves as the partition key, grouping related orders together based on this value. No dependency injection is required for this field. \n\n- **UUID**: `productId`\n    - **Type**: This UUID field uniquely identifies a product within an order. It acts as the clustering column and sorts records with the same partition key (order ID) based on their corresponding value in ascending order. No dependency injection is required for this field. \n\n## Methods\n(There are no methods defined in this class.)\n```"
