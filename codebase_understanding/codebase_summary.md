# Class Summary: [OrderController]
The OrderController class handles HTTP requests related to order management within a database application. It provides functionalities for creating, updating, deleting orders, and retrieving all or specific orders based on different criteria such as unique identifiers (UUIDs). The class is responsible for interacting with the OrderRepository component that abstracts data access layer operations.

## Package: 
com.datastax.examples.order

## File Path: 
src/main/java/com.datastax.examples/order/OrderController.java

## Fields
- **OrderRepository** (private OrderRepository orderRepository)
   - Type: The field is an instance of the OrderRepository class, which contains methods for accessing and manipulating data from a database using JPA or similar technologies. It serves as a dependency injection to enable interaction with the repository layer inside the controller's methods.

## Methods
- **root()** (ModelAndView)
  - Summary: Returns a ModelAndView object representing the root page of the order management system, which typically includes links or navigation elements for other pages/actions within the application.
  
- **createOrder(Request req, Response res)** (Order)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP POST request to create a new Order object with data from the client's input and saves it in the database using the repository layer. It then returns the created order as the response payload.
  
- **updateOrder(UUID id, Request req, Response res)** (Order)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP PUT or PATCH request to update a specific Order object identified by its UUID with new data from the client's input and saves it in the database using the repository layer. It then returns the updated order as the response payload.
  
- **deleteOrder(UUID id)** (void)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP DELETE request to remove a specific Order object identified by its UUID from the database and handles any related cleanup or cascading deletions using the repository layer. It does not return any response payload.
  
- **deleteOrders(UUID id)** (void)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP DELETE request to remove all Order objects that match a specific criterion, such as having a common property or attribute value identified by the UUID parameter from the database using the repository layer. It does not return any response payload.
  
- **findOrder(UUID id)** (ProductNameAndPrice)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP GET request to retrieve and return the details of a specific Order object identified by its UUID, including product name and price information. The returned data is fetched from the database using the repository layer.
  
- **findOrders(UUID id)** (List<ProductNameAndPrice>)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP GET request to retrieve a list of all Order objects that match a specific criterion, such as having a common property or attribute value identified by the UUID parameter from the database using the repository layer. It returns the retrieved data as a List object containing product name and price information for each order.
  
- **findAll()** (List<ProductNameAndPrice>)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP GET request to retrieve all Order objects in the system, including their product name and price information from the database using the repository layer. It returns the retrieved data as a List object containing product name and price information for each order.

# Class Summary: [OrderPrimaryKey]

- **Package**: `com.datastax.examples.order`
- **File Path**: `src/main/java/com/datastax/examples/order/OrderPrimaryKey.java`
- **Responsibility**: This class represents the primary key for an Order entity, containing UUID fields to uniquely identify each order and its associated product within a Cassandra database.

## Fields

- **UUID**: `orderId`
  - **Type**: Represents the unique identifier of the order itself. It is marked with `@PrimaryKeyColumn(name = "order_id", ordinal = 0, type = PrimaryKeyType.PARTITIONED)` to denote its role as a partition key in Cassandra's primary key structure.
  
- **UUID**: `productId`
  - **Type**: Represents the unique identifier of the product associated with the order. This is also marked with `@PrimaryKeyColumn(name = "product_id", ordinal = 1, type = PrimaryKeyType.CLUSTERED)` indicating that it serves as a clustering key in Cassandra's primary key scheme, which further refines the data retrieval within each partition identified by `orderId`.

Class Summary: SwaggerConfig
- Package: com.datastax.examples.swagger
- File Path: src/main/java/com.datastax.examples/swagger/SwaggerConfig.java
- Responsibility: Provides configuration for generating Swagger documentation for the 'orders' REST API, which is a sample REST API powered by DataStax Astra and serves as an example within the Spring Data Cassandra framework. It includes setup of Docket beans to define API information, group name, API selectors, path patterns, etc., using Spring Boot annotations and Swagger integration libraries.

## Fields
No fields defined in this class.

## Methods
- **api()**: `Docket`
  - Summary: Configures and returns a Docket bean that sets up the 'orders' API group with specific selectors, paths, and documentation information using Swagger. This method is responsible for creating the base configuration required by SpringFox to generate Swagger UI documentation based on annotations in controllers.
    - Internal Calls: `apiInfo()` - Used to provide detailed API info such as title, description, contact details, license, etc., which are then passed to Docket's apiInfo() method.
  - External Calls:
    - `Docket.groupName("orders")` - Specifies the group name of this API documentation in Swagger UI.
    - `newDocket.select()` - Selectors used to define which endpoints should be included in the generated documentation. In this case, all request handlers are selected using RequestHandlerSelectors.any().
    - `newDocket.apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())` - Specifies that all API controllers and their methods will be documented.
    - `newDocket.paths(PathSelectors.ant("/orders/**"))` - Defines the URL pattern for paths to include in the Swagger documentation. It includes any path starting with "/orders/".
    - `newDocket.build()` - Constructs a Docket bean with all the configurations set previously, which is then ready for use by SpringFox and other Swagger-related libraries.
    - `newDocket.apiInfo(apiInfo())` - Incorporates the API information details generated from calling the apiInfo() method into the final Docket configuration.

- **apiInfo()**: `ApiInfo`
  - Summary: Generates and returns an ApiInfo object containing all the necessary metadata for Swagger documentation, including title, version, description, contact info, license, etc., for this API. This information is utilized by Docket when generating the final swagger documentation output.
    - External Calls: `Collections.emptyList()` - Returns an empty list that can be used in cases where additional metadata components are required to be added dynamically or as part of a more complex configuration strategy (not applicable in this context but included for completeness).
