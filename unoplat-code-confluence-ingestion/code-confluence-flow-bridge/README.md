## Environment Variables

### Temporal Worker Configuration

The following environment variables can be used to configure the Temporal worker concurrency settings:

- `UNOPLAT_TEMPORAL_MAX_CONCURRENT_ACTIVITIES`: Sets the maximum number of activity tasks that the worker will execute concurrently (default: 4)
- `UNOPLAT_TEMPORAL_MAX_CONCURRENT_ACTIVITY_TASK_POLLS`: Sets the maximum number of concurrent poll requests the worker will make to the Temporal service for activity tasks (default: 2)

Tuning tips:

- If your worker is not fully utilizing its execution slots, consider increasing the number of pollers.
- If you see high CPU or memory usage, you may want to decrease the number of concurrent activities.
- The number of pollers should generally be less than or equal to the number of execution slots to avoid unnecessary polling overhead.
