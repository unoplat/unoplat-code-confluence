# Package Manager Detection Rules - Version 3
# 
# Simplified Python-only rules with ordered evaluation (no weights).
# Each signature is a homogeneous mapping with peer keys.
#
# Schema for each signature:
#   - file: <string>              - Match exact filename (required if glob not present)
#   - glob: <string>              - Match shell-style patterns (required if file not present)  
#   - contains: <string>          - Fixed substring that must appear in file (optional, only valid with file)
#   - contains_absence: <list>    - Strings that must NOT appear in file (optional, only valid with file)
#
# Key principles:
#   - All signature entries are mappings (no mixed scalar/mapping sequences)
#   - file, glob, contains, and contains_absence are peer keys at same indentation level
#   - Managers are evaluated in order: first match wins (no weight calculations)
#   - Ignores apply to all managers within a language
