"""Generic, language-agnostic filter utilities used by the concept-centric grammar engine.

Each function receives the canonical `MatchInfo` dictionary emitted by a `ConceptQuery` adapter
and returns a boolean indicating whether the match should be kept. These helpers are composed by
higher-level engines (e.g. PythonGrammarEngine) before persisting detections.

This module replaces ad-hoc inline filtering logic previously scattered across language engines.
It MUST NOT import any language-specific modules (keep this layer pure Python).
