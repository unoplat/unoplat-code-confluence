# 🚀 Latest Update: Nested Function Detection in Python Analysis 🚀

We're thrilled to announce that version 0.15.2 of Unoplat Code Confluence is now live! This update introduces our brand new **Nested Function Detection** feature, which brings deeper understanding to Python codebases by properly identifying and linking nested functions to their parent functions.

## ✨ What's New?

- **Intelligent Nested Function Detection**: 
  Automatically identify functions defined inside other functions and establish proper parent-child relationships, ensuring accurate code structure representation.

- **Comprehensive Support for Python Patterns**:
  Our detection works with simple nested functions, multiple nested functions in the same parent, decorated functions, multi-level nesting, conditional function definitions, and class method nesting.

- **Enhanced Visualization & Navigation**:
  See proper hierarchical relationships in code structure visualizations, enabling more intuitive navigation and better understanding of your codebase.

## 🔍 Why This Matters

Nested functions are powerful Python constructs that:
- Create scoping relationships affecting variable access
- Enable elegant design patterns like decorators and callbacks
- Often contain critical business logic tightly coupled to their parent context

By properly linking these relationships, you get:
- More accurate call graphs
- Better code structure visualization
- More precise code navigation
- Enhanced documentation with context-aware insights

## 💻 Technical Implementation

Under the hood, we're using Tree-sitter's AST parsing with specialized queries to:
1. Parse Python code into an Abstract Syntax Tree
2. Identify all function definitions using targeted queries
3. Determine parent-child relationships between functions
4. Set the `parent_function_name` field in the `UnoplatChapiForgeFunction` object

All of this happens with minimal performance impact and without modifying your source code!

## 🌟 Try It Today!

Ready to see nested function relationships in your own codebase? Check out our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.unoplat.io/docs/quickstart/how-to-run) to get up and running in minutes!

Once you're set up, try this Neo4j query to explore nested function relationships:
```cypher
MATCH (f:Function)-[:HAS_PARENT]->(p:Function)
RETURN f.name as NestedFunction, p.name as ParentFunction
```

## 🔮 What's Next?

We're continuing to enhance our Python code analysis capabilities. Coming soon:
- Improved visualization of nested function relationships
- Better handling of closures and variable capture
- Analysis of function object passing patterns
- Detection of callback patterns and event-driven architectures
