        '2. `from_file(file_path: str) -> Type[BaseTool]`: This method dynamically imports a BaseTool class from a Python file within a package structure. The `file_path` parameter specifies the path to the Python file. If the import is successful, it checks if the imported class is a subclass of `BaseTool` and returns it.',
        '3. `get_openapi_schema(tools: List[Type[BaseTool]], url: str, title="Agent Tools", description="A collection of tools.") -> str`: This method generates an OpenAPI schema from a list of BaseTools. It creates a base OpenAPI schema with the specified title and description, then iterates over each tool in the list, adding its details to the schema as separate endpoints.'
