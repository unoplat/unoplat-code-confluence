# Limitations and Resolutions

This document tracks known limitations in code parsing capabilities and their resolution status across supported programming languages.

## Status Legend

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| âœ… RESOLVED | Issue has been fixed in our implementation and upstream |
| ðŸŸ¡ PARTIAL | Issue has been partially resolved or has a workaround |
| ðŸ”´ ACTIVE | Known limitation that is currently being addressed |
| ðŸ“… PLANNED | Issue is scheduled to be resolved in an upcoming release |
| âšª UNPLANNED | Known limitation with no current plans for resolution |

## Python

### Active Limitations

| Feature | Status | Description | Impact | Workaround |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Function Dependency Sorting | âšª UNPLANNED | Circular dependencies and recursive functions cannot be properly sorted as topological sort is used | May result in incomplete dependency graphs for codebases with circular references | Manual review may be required for circular dependencies |
| Function Return Type Parsing | ðŸ“… PLANNED | Return types are not being properly captured in certain cases | May result in incomplete type information in the code grammar | Manual annotation of return types may be required |

### Resolved Limitations

| Feature | Status | Resolution Date | Description | Resolution Details |
|---------|--------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Function Call Parsing | âœ… RESOLVED | Q2 2023 | Method calls through class names were not being detected | Fixed in our implementation and in upstream [Issue #33](https://github.com/phodal/chapi/issues/33) |
| Class and Instance Variables | âœ… RESOLVED | Q3 2023 | Class variables and instance variables were only available per function, not per class/procedure | Fixed in our implementation and in upstream [Issue #32](https://github.com/phodal/chapi/issues/32). Previous POC using tree-sitter is no longer needed |

## Recent Improvements

Each release cycle, we actively work to resolve known limitations. Recent highlights include:

- Complete resolution of variable scope detection issues
- Enhanced method call detection through class names
