        "summary": "## Class Summary: [OrderController]\nThe OrderController class handles HTTP requests related to orders within a system that manages products and their prices. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on order entities through various endpoints. The controller utilizes the Spring Framework's MVC architecture for web application development and integrates with an OrderRepository component to interact with data sources using Java Persistence API (JPA).\n\n## Fields\n- **OrderRepository**: `Autowired`\n  - Type: Injected dependency that provides CRUD operations on order entities. The Spring framework's `@Autowired` annotation is used for automatic dependency injection of the repository instance into the OrderController class. This allows easy access to data layer functionality through defined methods within the OrderRepository interface/class.\n\n## Methods\n- **root()**: `ModelAndView`\n  - Summary: Displays a redirection view that navigates users to the Swagger UI page for API documentation and testing. This method is typically mapped to the base path of the API, such as \"/orders\".\n  \n- **createOrder(HttpServletRequest request)**: `Order`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP POST requests to create new order entities in the data source by extracting relevant information from the HttpServletRequest object and saving it using OrderRepository.save(). This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders\".\n  \n- **updateOrder(HttpServletRequest request)**: `Order`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP PUT requests for updating existing order entities by retrieving the current state of the entity, modifying it based on provided parameters in HttpServletRequest, and then persisting changes using OrderRepository.save(). This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders/{id}\".\n  \n- **deleteOrder(HttpServletRequest request)**: `void`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP DELETE requests for deleting specific order entities by retrieving the entity's primary key from HttpServletRequest and removing it using OrderRepository.deleteByKeyOrderIdAndKeyProductId() or OrderRepository.deleteByKeyOrderId(). This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders/{id}\" or \"/orders/\".\n  \n- **deleteOrders(HttpServletRequest request)**: `void`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP DELETE requests for deleting multiple order entities by identifying a filter criteria (e.g., all orders with a specific product ID) and removing them using OrderRepository.deleteByKeyOrderId(). This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders/product/{id}\".\n  \n- **findOrder(HttpServletRequest request)**: `ProductNameAndPrice`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP GET requests for retrieving a single order entity's details by its primary key, which can be extracted from HttpServletRequest. The method utilizes OrderRepository.findByKeyOrderIdAndKeyProductId() to fetch the corresponding data and wrap it in a ProductNameAndPrice object before returning it as an API response. This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders/{id}\".\n  \n- **findOrders(HttpServletRequest request)**: `List<ProductNameAndPrice>`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP GET requests for retrieving multiple order entities' details, optionally filtered by a specific primary key value. The method utilizes OrderRepository.findByKeyOrderId() to fetch the corresponding data and return it as a list of ProductNameAndPrice objects in the API response. This method is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders/{id}\" or \"/orders\".\n  \n- **findAll(HttpServletRequest request)**: `List<ProductNameAndPrice>`\n  - Summary: Processes HTTP GET requests for retrieving all order entities' details by leveraging OrderRepository.findAllProjectedBy(). This method provides a list of ProductNameAndPrice objects representing the complete set of orders in the system, excluding any deleted records (soft delete strategy). It is typically mapped to an endpoint like \"/orders\".\n\nPlease note that for each method mapping and HTTP request processing, annotations such as `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc., would be used within a Spring MVC controller class. Additionally, you may need to import classes/packages required by the methods (e.g., HttpServletRequest) depending on your project setup."

        "summary": "Class Summary: The `SwaggerConfig` class provides Swagger API documentation configuration and setup for a REST API serving data from a Cassandra database. It defines how the generated documentation will be structured, which endpoints are included, and metadata about the API itself.\n\n\nFile Path: src/main/java/com/datastax/examples/swagger/SwaggerConfig.java\n\nResponsibility: The `SwaggerConfig` class is responsible for configuring Swagger to generate API documentation for a Spring Data Cassandra-based RESTful service named \"Orders\". It sets up the metadata and structure of the generated documentation, including information about the API's versioning, licensing terms, contact details, and available endpoints.\n\n\n## Fields: None (no fields are defined in this class)\n\n\n## Methods:\n- **api()**: This method generates a `Docket` object with Swagger configuration for the \"Orders\" API group. It specifies the endpoint paths to be included, selects all available request handlers, and builds the documentation using an instance of `ApiInfo`. The generated documentation will include information such as the API title (\"Spring Data Cassandra REST API\"), description, version number, terms of service link, licensing details, and a contact person/entity.\n  - **Summary**: Configures Swagger to generate API documentation for the \"Orders\" group within a Spring Data Cassandra-based RESTful service. It specifies the endpoints, request handlers, and other metadata to be included in the generated documentation.\n  \nInternal Calls:\n    - `apiInfo()` method is called inside this method to retrieve an instance of `ApiInfo` for use when building the Swagger API information.\n\nExternal Calls:\n    - `Docket.groupName(\"orders\")`: Sets the group name in the generated documentation as \"Orders\".\n    - `newDocket.select()`: Specifies that all available request handlers should be included in the documentation generation process.\n    - `newDocket.apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())`: Includes any and all Spring-managed request handler methods to be documented by Swagger.\n    - `newDocket.paths(PathSelectors.ant(\"/orders/**\"))`: Specifies that only API endpoints under the \"/orders/\" path should be included in the documentation.\n    - `newDocket.build()`: Builds and returns a configured instance of Docket with all previously specified options applied.\n    - `newDocket.apiInfo(apiInfo())`: Adds an instance of `ApiInfo` to the Swagger configuration, which contains metadata about the API itself, including its title, description, version number, terms of service link, licensing details, and contact person/entity information.\n  \n- **apiInfo()**: This method creates an instance of `ApiInfo` with specific metadata about the \"Spring Data Cassandra REST API\" for use when configuring Swagger to generate documentation. It includes basic info (title and description), version number, terms of service link, licensing details, contact information, and a list of supported media types (in this case an empty list).\n  - **Summary**: Creates an instance of ApiInfo with metadata about the REST API for inclusion in Swagger documentation. This includes basic info such as title, description, version number, terms of service link, licensing details, contact information, and a list of supported media types (currently empty).\n  - **External Calls**: `Collections.emptyList()` is called to create an empty list for the supported media types parameter in the ApiInfo instance."

It encapsulates settings related to secure connect bundle file paths, connection details, etc., using Lombok annotations for getters and setters, as well as annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties` for type-safe property binding.\n\n## Fields\n- **File**: `None`\n  - **Type**: The class does not directly manage a File instance; however, it contains a private field intended to represent the path or reference to a secure connect bundle file necessary for establishing connections with the DataStax Astra database. This would typically be injected via Spring's dependency injection mechanism if applicable in practice.\n\n## Methods\n- The `DataStaxAstraProperties` class does not contain explicit methods as per the provided metadata, but it is expected to have generated getter and setter methods for its properties due to Lombok annotations such as `@Getter` and `@Setter`. These methods facilitate accessing and updating property values within the application.\n```"
