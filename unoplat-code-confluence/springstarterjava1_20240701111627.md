**Implementation:** The "deleteOrder" function in the "OrderController" class is responsible for deleting an order based on the provided order ID and product ID. It first retrieves the order repository instance using the autowired "orderRepository" field. Then, it calls the "deleteByKeyOrderIdAndKeyProductId" function from the "OrderRepository" class, passing in the "oid"

##### deleteOrders

**Objective:** The objective of the "deleteOrders" function is to delete orders based on the provided order ID by calling the "deleteByKeyOrderId" function of the "OrderRepository" class.

**Implementation:** The "deleteOrders" function in the "OrderController" class is responsible for deleting orders based on the provided order ID. It takes in a path variable called "oid" of type "UUID". Inside the function, it calls the "deleteByKeyOrderId" function of the "OrderRepository" class, passing in the "oid" parameter. This function does not return any

##### findOrder

**Objective:** The objective of the "findOrder" function is to retrieve the order with the specified order ID and product ID from the database.

**Implementation:** The "findOrder" function in the "OrderController" class is implemented as follows:

1. The function takes in two path variables, "oid" and "pid", of type UUID.
2. Inside the function, it makes a function call to the "findByKeyOrderIdAndKeyProductId" function of the "OrderRepository" class, passing in the "oid"

##### findOrders

**Objective:** The objective of the "findOrders" function is to retrieve a list of "ProductNameAndPrice" objects based on the given order ID.

**Implementation:** This function, "findOrders", is implemented in the "OrderController" class. It takes in a path variable, "oid", of type UUID. The function returns a list of "ProductNameAndPrice" objects.
