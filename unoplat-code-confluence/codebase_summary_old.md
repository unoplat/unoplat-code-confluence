# Class Summary: [OrderController]
The OrderController class handles HTTP requests related to order management within a database application. It provides functionalities for creating, updating, deleting orders, and retrieving all or specific orders based on different criteria such as unique identifiers (UUIDs). The class is responsible for interacting with the OrderRepository component that abstracts data access layer operations.

## Package: 
com.datastax.examples.order

## File Path: 
src/main/java/com.datastax.examples/order/OrderController.java

## Fields
- **OrderRepository** (private OrderRepository orderRepository)
   - Type: The field is an instance of the OrderRepository class, which contains methods for accessing and manipulating data from a database using JPA or similar technologies. It serves as a dependency injection to enable interaction with the repository layer inside the controller's methods.

## Methods

- **updateOrder(UUID id, Request req, Response res)** (Order)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP PUT or PATCH request to update a specific Order object identified by its UUID with new data from the client's input and saves it in the database using the repository layer. It then returns the updated order as the response payload.
  
- **deleteOrder(UUID id)** (void)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP DELETE request to remove a specific Order object identified by its UUID from the database and handles any related cleanup or cascading deletions using the repository layer. It does not return any response payload.
  
- **deleteOrders(UUID id)** (void)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP DELETE request to remove all Order objects that match a specific criterion, such as having a common property or attribute value identified by the UUID parameter from the database using the repository layer. It does not return any response payload.
  
- **findOrder(UUID id)** (ProductNameAndPrice)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP GET request to retrieve and return the details of a specific Order object identified by its UUID, including product name and price information. The returned data is fetched from the database using the repository layer.
  
- **findOrders(UUID id)** (List<ProductNameAndPrice>)
  - Summary: Processes an HTTP GET request to retrieve a list of all Order objects that match a specific criterion, such as having a common property or attribute value identified by the UUID parameter from the database using the repository layer. It returns the retrieved data as a List object containing product name and price information for each order.
  
- **findAll()** (List<ProductNameAndPrice>)
